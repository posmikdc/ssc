\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

\begin{frame}{Concerns}
- Is control data accurate enough?
- Is the existing elbow and silhouette methods good enough?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{My research questions}
- Continuous treatment (is there an opportunity to exploit within-time variation in treatment response while holding space constant? Maybe Callaway et al. 2021?)
- Could this idea be translated into a real study? How would I access data that is reliable?
- Can a random mask matrix serve as a tool to measure uncertainty? Think MC Dropout in spatial setting via convolutions
\end{frame}
