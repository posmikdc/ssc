        \item Measuring the effect of climate disasters
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Experimental approaches - if not unethical - are nearly impossible
            \item Researchers are stuck with observational data
            \item Recovering robust causal effects is critical policy input
            \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Brainstorming}
- Think about mapping hospitals etc. 
- But also public facilities that are AC controlled??? These could be identified with the help of and conversations with community members and stewards
- Insight maybe: High-income - ppl just hunker down in their AC controlled places; low-income: Do people try to "escape"/ "flee" the heat to other places???
- classify/ define the concept of a "HEAT SHELTER" in addition to hospitals
- Define the median location of an individual as their home; also look into work location?
